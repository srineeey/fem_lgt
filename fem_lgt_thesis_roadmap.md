Open points to complete:

- LGT+FEM

    - consistent orientation of gauge links (gfor vs vertex numbering - need to check more carefully!)

    - Wilson loop weights with mass matrices
    - Interpolation of continuous fields
    - Electric and Magnetic Energy Densities

    - Periodic BC LGT (for links, charge, gauges - ngsolve technicality!)

    - Vortices LGT (one demo)
    - Comparison with LGT (Dirichlet BC)

	



Notes:

The components of forms do not carry a 1/k! factor for overcounting

even though the coefficient matrix of the Lie algebra inner product depends on the exact basis chosen, the prefactors when scaling the basis globally are cancelled in the time stepping formulation by global division

- choose a single Lie algebra basis
    - or cross product basis (continuous YM) - 1/(2i) sigma
	- quaternion basis (LGT YM) -  1/i sigma
